# Blaise NuGet API 

This Blaise API library offers an abstraction of the interfaces provided by the official Blaise API DLL library. It offers a high level CRUD style interface that is easier to work with. This library is available internally to the ONS via an Azure DevOps artifact feed.

# Concepts

This solution utilizes concepts from the SOLID principles of development. In order to facilitate unit testing, dependency injection has been used throughout the code base.

# Local setup

Populate the App.config file accordingly, **never commit a populated App.config file!**

# Usage

This repository contains several packages. The contracts package contains the interface for the API, you can use this package in your project unit test mocks, so you do not need to consume the complete functionality.

You can use the fluid API style class 'FluentBlaiseApi', which implements the 'IFluentBlaiseApi' interface.
		
# Azure DevOps pipeline

The yml file in the root of the repository is used to create the Azure DevOps pipeline. The pipeline is triggered whenever changes are pushed to main.

To update the pipeline, make changes to the yml file and then commit/push to this GitHub repository. If you need to test on a feature branch, commit/push changes and then go into the Azure DevOps console UI. From there you can run the pipeline manually by selecting the relevant branch.
